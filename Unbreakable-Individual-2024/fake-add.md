**Flag : <span style="color:rgb(60, 179, 113)">CTF{th1s_is_ju5T_ADD}</span>**

## Solution

Sincerely, this is not my work GPT helps me a lot.
First I decompiled the file with `ghidra` and watched inside to see something but I abandoned this plan, after a few hours I searched for another challenge of pwn something and I found `cutter`, which is similiar to ghidra or IDA PRO, but for this challenge it helps me.

In cutter, I see some operations and I ask ChatGPT if he can make me a Python script to add them and solve the flag ... and it works :)
